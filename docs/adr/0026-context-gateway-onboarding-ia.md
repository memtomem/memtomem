# ADR-0026: Context Gateway first-time-user onboarding & comprehension layer

**Status:** Accepted & partially shipped — P0 and P1a/P1b are merged; the
P1 Simple-as-default flip and all of P2 remain deferred pending the
§Validation first-run user test. See §"Implementation status (as of
2026-06-17)". D-F (staged rollout, Advanced default first) is followed.
**D-A is now decided (2026-06-17):** the Web display uses friendly tier
labels ("User" / "Project (shared)" / "Project (local)") + a "Stored in"
axis — a narrow supersession of ADR-0016 §7 for Web display copy only, with
the CLI / request identifiers unchanged. The remaining provisional decisions
(D-B / D-C) stay open, gated on the §Validation user test.
**Date:** 2026-06-14 (status updated 2026-06-17)
**Context:** A first-time-user end-to-end smoke test of the Context Gateway
web UI (driven through Playwright against an isolated, seeded HOME) found
that the dashboard is *functionally* complete but *conceptually* opaque to
a new user. Tracking issue: #1353. This ADR records the proposed
onboarding / information-architecture (IA) layer that sits **on top of**
the already-accepted Context Gateway architecture (ADR-0009 info surface,
ADR-0011 canonical scope hierarchy, ADR-0015 request vocabulary, ADR-0016
three-tier store, ADR-0021 portal, ADR-0023 transfer). It does **not**
re-open any of those decisions.

The Gateway exposes a four-axis model — artifact-type × tier × project ×
sync-state — without ever stating the single idea that makes the rest
legible: **memtomem keeps one source-of-truth store under `.memtomem/`
and pushes it one-way out to runtime tools (Claude Code, Codex, Kimi…).**
Because that model is never surfaced in the UI, every downstream label
("canonical", "tier", "enroll", "fan-out", "Sync" vs "Import", and four
overlapping status badges) reads as undefined jargon, and a first-time
user cannot answer five basic questions: *What is canonical? Sync or
Import? Which project am I in? Where do errors live? Why enroll?*

## Scope and non-goals

This ADR is about the **user-facing display + onboarding layer only**. It
is deliberately **non-normative** on the request / identifier vocabulary:

- It does **not** rename `project_scope_id` or `target_scope` — those are
  the request-vocabulary terms fixed by **ADR-0015**, kept verbatim for
  backward compatibility.
- It does **not** preempt the deferred `target_scope` → `target_tier`
  *identifier* rename — ADR-0016 §"Open questions" raises it; TRACKER.md
  (row "0016 §2") binds it to #922 with a 2026-08-11 review window. Any
  display-term change proposed here is a separate, display-only concern and
  must not be read as resolving #922.
- It does **not** change any route, schema, gate, or sync behaviour
  (ADR-0011 §3 `project_local` no-fan-out, ADR-0015 §4 product semantics,
  ADR-0023 transfer gates all stand). It changes copy, one display-label
  helper, and additive UI affordances.
- **Caveat — ADR-0016 §7 (load-bearing).** ADR-0016 §7 ("CLI / Web UI
  user-facing names") **decided** that user-facing surfaces use the literal
  tier tokens `user` / `project_shared` / `project_local` and **rejects**
  display aliases ("Personal" / "Team" / "Local Draft"). D-A (decided
  2026-06-17) **narrowly supersedes ADR-0016 §7 for Web display copy only**:
  the Context Gateway **Web** surface renders friendly labels ("User" /
  "Project (shared)" / "Project (local)") + a "Stored in" axis and defines
  them, while CLI `--scope=` flags, `?target_scope=` params, config, MCP, and
  path segments keep the literal tokens unchanged. So this ADR is
  non-normative on prior decisions **except** that D-A narrowly supersedes
  ADR-0016 §7 for Web display copy.

The string-level localization/copy *defects* found by the same smoke test
are tracked and fixed separately (#1348 raw move/copy verbs, #1349 portal
empty-state empty quotes, #1350 `reason_code` → i18n leaks, #1351
`settings.ctx.*`/`settings.hooks.*` ko.json gap + install-guide literals,
#1352 wording polish). Those make the existing words *correct and
translated*; this ADR makes the words *comprehensible in the first place*.
The two layers are complementary: the glossary below is intended to be the
single source of truth that #1351's bulk ko.json pass localizes against
(so EN and KO converge on the same user-facing terms instead of
transliterating "canonical" → "캐노니컬").

## Decision

### 1. Surface the mental model in the UI (do not leave it to docs)

State the model once, in the Overview, in plain language:

> memtomem keeps one **Store** (your master copies, in `.memtomem/`).
> **Sync** pushes them out to your **Runtimes** — Claude Code, Codex,
> Kimi. **Import** pulls existing ones back in. The flow is one-way:
> edit in the Store, then Sync.

```
   ┌─────────────────┐                          ┌──────────────┐
   │  STORE          │      ── Sync (push) ──▶   │  Claude Code │
   │  .memtomem/     │                      ├──▶ │  Codex       │
   │  (your masters) │      ◀── Import (pull) ── │  Kimi …      │
   │  Scope: User ·  │      (subset, fixed order)│  (RUNTIMES)  │
   │  Shared · Draft │                          └──────────────┘
   └─────────────────┘   one-way fan-out; a Runtime copy is
                         overwritten on the next Sync.
```

The Store is the single write source. Sync is one-way out (fan-out to
every detected runtime). Import is the narrow exception — pulling a
runtime copy back in, only from runtimes that are read-readable (other
runtimes are export-only). Drafts (the `project_local` tier) are
deliberately never pushed (ADR-0011 §3).

The reason this must be in the UI and not only in docs: the audits showed
every on-screen label is *only* interpretable relative to this model,
which today exists only in the maintainer's head, in code comments, and
across ADR-0011/0015/0016.

### 2. A single user-facing display glossary

Adopt one consistent set of **display** terms. The left column is the
current jargon that should disappear from user-facing strings (it survives
only in code, request params, and ADRs).

| Current jargon (UI) | Recommended display term | One-line definition |
|---|---|---|
| canonical / canonical store | **Store** ("Stored source" already used at `en.json:591`) | The single master copy of an item, in `.memtomem/`; the one place Sync reads from. |
| runtime / runtimes | **Runtimes** (kept) | The AI tools memtomem pushes to: Claude Code, Codex, Kimi… detected on your machine. |
| fan-out | **Sync** / "pushes" (verb) | Copying the Store's items out to every detected runtime — one-way. |
| Sync / Sync All | **Sync** (kept) | Push the Store's items out to your runtimes. |
| Import | **Import** (kept) | Pull an existing item from a runtime back into the Store. |
| tier (the `target_scope` axis) | **"Stored in" / "Store in"** (저장 위치) — _decided, D-A (2026-06-17)_; "Tier" kept only as the code/concept word; "Scope" rejected (collides with ADR-0015) | Where in the Store a copy lives and how widely it applies. |
| user / project_shared / project_local (values) | **Web display: friendly labels** "User" / "Project (shared)" / "Project (local)" + a one-line tooltip (_decided, D-A_ — narrow ADR-0016 §7 supersession, Web display only); CLI / params / config keep the literal tokens. | All your projects / committed to git, your team gets it / gitignored draft, never pushed. |
| enroll | **Track** ("Enable sync") | Opt a project in to receiving pushes — like adding a git remote. |
| Server CWD | the project's real label + a **`(current folder)`** marker | The folder the server launched in; show the real label, not a synthetic second identity. |
| status: out of sync / not in runtime | **Out of sync → Sync** / **Not in runtimes → Sync** | Store has changes/items the runtime lacks; Sync to push. |
| status: not yet imported | **In runtime only → Import** | A runtime has an item the Store doesn't; Import to bring it in. |

`project_shared` means "git-tracked", **not** "shared between agents"
(inherited verbatim from ADR-0011 / ADR-0015 Terminology). Under D-A's
friendly rendered labels, the `project_shared` tooltip must still
carry that meaning ("committed to git — your team will see it"); the
`project_local` tooltip must carry "gitignored draft — never pushed"
(ADR-0011 §3).

**Vocabulary-collision note (load-bearing).** The proposal that seeded
this ADR suggested displaying the tier axis as "Scope". That is rejected
here as written, because **ADR-0015 explicitly retired unqualified
"scope"** — it already names two distinct dimensions, `project_scope_id`
(project-root selector) and `target_scope` (tier). Introducing "Scope" as
the *display* word for the tier axis would re-create exactly the ambiguity
ADR-0015 fought, and would collide with the project axis users already
read as "Project". "Scope" stays rejected as the display word. The
tier-axis display term was an open question (D-A); it is **now resolved
(2026-06-17)** to the already-shipped, non-colliding UI label
**"Stored in" / "저장 위치"**, which the glossary defines (the other kept
candidates were "Storage location" and "Visibility"; "Tier" survives only
as the code/concept word).

### 3. Phased delivery — Minimal → Moderate → (validate) → Bold

The three approaches evaluated are not mutually exclusive; they are
increasing depths of the same fix (surface the model → restructure
exposure → re-vocabularize). Ship in order; each phase de-risks the next
and is independently shippable.

| Dimension | **P0 Minimal** | **P1 Moderate** | **P2 Bold** |
|---|---|---|---|
| What changes | Additive copy only: Overview primer + canonical→runtime diagram + always-visible status legend + 3 glossary tooltips + 1 confirm-string rewrite + 1 display-label helper edit | Default **Simple mode** with progressive disclosure: tier/project axes hidden behind an **Advanced** toggle; per-type inline-action rows; 3-state display remap | Full re-frame around a `git push` metaphor (verb rename Sync→Push↑ / Import→Pull↓, status collapse to ahead/behind/in-sync) |
| First-user impact | States the model once + keeps a legend in view; ~80% of comprehension gain | Collapses the steepest cliff (mandatory tier axis + 4 statuses) into one primary task | Highest comprehension for the git-native audience; direction is in the verb |
| Effort / Risk | **S–M / Low** (reuses tested patterns; no badge-ladder/gate/confirm-math change) | M / Medium (default-flip discipline, two label layers) | L / Medium-high (terminology churn breaks external docs/screenshots; one-way) |
| Reversibility | Trivial (all additive) | High (Advanced toggle restores today's UI verbatim) | Low (central-verb rename is a one-way product decision) |

**Recommendation: accept P0 now, scope P1 next, and gate P2 behind a
first-run user test.** P2's central-verb rename is the single
highest-comprehension move but is communication-heavy and irreversible; it
must only follow validation (see §Validation).

#### P0 — Minimal (proposed for immediate scheduling)

Each item: **what** · **where** · **acceptance criterion**.

1. **Overview primer banner** · clone the `tab-help-bar` pattern (e.g.
   `index.html:161-163`, also used by the Index/Sources tabs) into
   `#settings-ctx-overview` after the desc at `index.html:567`, scoped
   `data-help-tab="ctx-overview"`; new key `settings.ctx.primer` (EN+KO)
   · *Banner renders expanded on first visit; dismiss persists via
   `body.help-hidden`, independent of the other tabs' dismiss state.*
2. **Store→runtime flow diagram** · a new `#ctx-flow-diagram` flex child
   inserted into the existing `.ctx-overview-header` between
   `.ctx-overview-root` and `.ctx-overview-runtimes`
   (`context-gateway.js:1495-1500`); ~6 lines CSS · *An explicit
   `Store ──Sync→── Runtimes` arrow is visible without scrolling; reuses
   the existing header box (no new container).*
3. **Always-visible status legend** · one `.help-tip` "i" popover on the
   Overview `<h2>` (`index.html:569`); new key
   `settings.ctx.status_legend` mapping each of the four statuses
   (`status_in_sync`/`status_out_of_sync`/`status_missing_target`/
   `status_missing_canonical`, `en.json:497-500`) to its single resolving
   action · *Hovering/focusing the "i" reveals "In sync = nothing to do ·
   Not in runtime → Sync · Not yet imported → Import · Out of sync →
   Sync". No badge string mutated.*
4. **Glossary tooltips on the worst on-screen terms** · `.help-tip` next
   to the tier-filter label and "Runtimes" (`context-gateway.js:1500`),
   plus rewrite the confirm jargon leak at `en.json:415`
   (`move_copy_shared_confirm_message`) so raw `canonical` /
   `project_shared` no longer appear in the move/copy confirmation ·
   *"canonical"/"project_shared" no longer appear raw in the UI; tier +
   runtimes definitions are one hover away.* (Coordinate with #1348, which
   also touches this confirm copy.)
5. **Consistent project naming** · edit `_ctxScopeDisplayLabel`
   (`context-gateway.js:579`) so the cwd case *appends* a
   `(current folder)` marker instead of *replacing* the whole label with
   "Server CWD"; new key `settings.ctx.cwd_marker`; unlabeled folders keep
   the `server_cwd` fallback · *The same folder shows one consistent name
   everywhere it routes through this helper (dropdown, overview header,
   move/copy confirm).*
6. **i18n + gate hygiene** · pair every new key EN+KO in the same change;
   bump `?v=N` cache-bust on changed JS/CSS; add new keys to
   `test_i18n.py` parity; the primer's `data-i18n-html` passes the
   innerHTML/langchange checklist · *`test_i18n.py` green; cache-bust
   bumped; langchange re-renders the primer in place.*

```

#### P1 — Moderate (proposed for the next iteration)

1. **Simple/Advanced toggle** (`localStorage` flag) shows/hides
   `#ctx-control-bar` and the Projects/Wiki/Hooks nav. Simple is the
   *target* default — but per D-F the rollout is staged (ship with
   **Advanced default first**, flip to Simple after the §Validation user
   test). Advanced restores today's UI verbatim; `#ctx-control-bar` stays
   in the DOM (hidden) so the existing hoist guard stays green.
2. **One-line verdict + per-type inline actions** — each surfaced problem
   carries its resolving verb button on its own row; Sync vs Import is
   never ambiguous.
3. **3-state Simple labels** (display remap only) — Advanced keeps the
   original four; no status string mutated; confirm create/overwrite math
   untouched.
4. **Default-flip fan-out** — Simple-as-default ships with its
   onboarding-docs fan-out in the same change (per the repo's
   default-change discipline); consider a staged opt-in (Advanced default,
   flip after the user test) — see D-F.

**Simple default mode (P1) — low-fi mockup:**

```

#### P2 — Bold (deferred, gated on a first-run user test)

Re-frame as a "git push console": rename Sync→Push↑ / Import→Pull↓,
collapse the statuses to ahead/behind/in-sync (+ two error states), add a
`git status`-style headline verdict, and — as a *separate, later*
supersession of the now-decided D-A display copy — optionally re-frame the
tier labels under the same metaphor (e.g. Global/Shared/Draft). This relabels
~40 `settings.ctx.*` keys in both locales and breaks external
docs/screenshots, so it is **deferred pending** the §Validation user test.
Backend `reason_code`s and request vocabulary (ADR-0015) are unchanged.

## Consequences

- A first-time user can state the canonical→runtime model and pick Sync
  vs Import without hovering — the #1 documented failure — after P0.
- The glossary (§2) becomes the term set #1351's ko.json pass localizes
  against; #1351 and this ADR must agree on terms before either lands
  user-facing strings, to avoid double-churn.
- No behavioural, route, schema, or gate change in P0/P1. P2 changes only
  display copy + status presentation, never `reason_code`s or request
  params (ADR-0015 preserved).
- P0 item 4 overlaps #1348's confirm-copy edit at `en.json:415`;
  sequencing must be coordinated (D-E) so the two do not collide.
- The tier display-term decision (D-A) is **taken** (2026-06-17): the Web
  display uses friendly labels + a "Stored in" axis (narrow ADR-0016 §7
  supersession, Web display only) without colliding with ADR-0015 or
  pre-empting #922 — request identifiers (`target_scope`) are unchanged.

## Implementation status (as of 2026-06-17)

Shipped-state companion to the phased plan in §3. #1353 remains the home
for the remaining work; this table is the source of truth for *what has
landed* so that later work does not re-implement shipped pieces or read the
provisional design language as an unstarted project. Phase rows map to
merged PRs; verify by symbol grep if the §"Source files" line numbers have
drifted.

| Phase / item | Status | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 — Minimal** — Overview primer, Store→Runtimes flow diagram, always-visible status legend, glossary tooltips, `(current folder)` naming, i18n/a11y hygiene (D-G) | **Shipped** | #1356 |
| P0-3 status-legend help-tip a11y — static aria-label | **Shipped** (follow-up) | #1377 |
| P0-4 confirm/glossary de-jargon — `move_copy_shared_confirm_message` rewritten (now "…into the project's shared store — committed to git…", no raw `canonical`/`project_shared`); scope-ID tooltips; nav glossary *defines* "canonical" | **Shipped** | #1356 (confirm rewrite); de-jargon companion PRs #1368 / #1375 (under issue #1352) |
| **P1a — Simple-mode scaffold** — Simple/Advanced `localStorage` toggle, read-only, **Advanced default** (D-F staged opt-in) | **Shipped** | #1358 |
| **P1b — Simple-mode inline actions** — per-type Sync/Import rows, cross-tier empty-state summary (D-D lean iii), 3-state Simple labels | **Shipped** | #1360 |
| **P1 — Simple-as-default flip** (D-F) | **Deferred** — gated on the §Validation user test | — |
| **P2 — Bold** — Push/Pull verb rename, status collapse to ahead/behind/in-sync (D-B / D-C) | **Deferred** — gated on the §Validation user test | — |

**§Validation status:**

- *Heuristic terminology guard.* **Partially in place.** Per-key
  jargon-free guards already cover the shipped surfaces —
  `test_ctx_p0_onboarding_keys_jargon_free`,
  `test_ctx_scope_id_tooltips_jargon_free`, and the #1352 tier/enroll
  guards in `packages/memtomem/tests/test_i18n.py` — each enumerating the
  specific user-facing keys and forbidding raw `canonical` /
  `project_shared` / `project_local` / `fan-out` in their values. A
  **blanket** scan over all `settings.ctx.*` values is deliberately **not**
  used: "canonical" is a legitimate product term on the Wiki editor surface
  (where `test_ctx_nav_sub_glossary_consistency` requires it to be
  *defined*, not removed) and also appears as the `{canonical}` path
  placeholder in empty-state hints,
  so a namespace-wide grep would false-positive. Extending the per-key
  guard as new user-facing keys are added remains open work under #1353.
- *First-run user test (5–6 naive participants).* **Not yet run.** It gates
  the P1 default flip and all of P2. Use the pass bars defined below
  verbatim — they are the single source of truth; do not re-derive
  thresholds elsewhere.

**Companion string issues** #1348 / #1349 / #1350 / #1351 / #1352 — all
**closed**.

## Validation

Because the audits behind this ADR were produced by an *informed* tester
(who already knows the model), the comprehension claims must be re-checked
against genuinely naive behaviour before the irreversible P2 ships.

**Heuristic re-check (cheap, per phase):** re-run a Nielsen pass after P0
and confirm the previously-violated heuristics (visibility of system
status, match-real-world, recognition-over-recall, help/docs) now pass on
the Overview surface. Add a `test_i18n.py`-style source-grep guard that
fails if the purged jargon (`canonical`, `project_shared`,
`project_local`, `fan-out`) re-enters user-facing strings outside code
comments.

**Lightweight first-run user test (5–6 participants, ~20 min):** recruit
Claude Code / Codex CLI developers who have never used the Gateway; fresh
isolated HOME; single task *"get this project's skills into Claude Code."*
Observe without hints. Probes: (1) direction — "which button fixes 'Out of
sync' vs 'Not yet imported' without hovering?"; (2) model — "where's the
master copy, what does Sync do?"; (3) identity — "how many projects, which
are you in?"; (4) scope — "you want your teammate to get this skill —
which tier?"; (5) **safety (P2 gate)** — "what will Push do to the Claude
copy that's ahead?" (must predict "overwrite"); (6) recovery — seed a
parse-error item, "what's wrong, how fix?". **Pass bars:** P0 ships if
probes 1–3 succeed for ≥4/6 without docs; P2 is gated on probe 5
succeeding for ≥5/6 and the status-merge not costing power users the
create-vs-overwrite distinction.

## Provisional decisions

These are the author's **recommended leans**, filled in so the ADR reads
as a concrete draft. Each is **provisional** — it records the chosen
option *and keeps its alternatives* so the maintainer can re-open any one
without re-deriving the analysis. Until the maintainer confirms, treat
each D-x as a recommendation, not a settled decision — **except D-A, which
is now decided (2026-06-17); D-B–D-G remain leans.** (Each D-x maps 1:1
to the prior open question Q-x.)

- **D-A. Tier vocabulary — axis term AND value display. — DECIDED 2026-06-17
  (ratifies what shipped in #1356 / #1372).**
  - **Decision (Web display):** (i) the axis display term is **"Stored in" /
    "Store in"** (KO "저장 위치") — the non-colliding alternative; "Scope"
    stays rejected (collides with ADR-0015's retired unqualified "scope") and
    "Tier" is kept only as the *code/concept* word, never rendered as the Web
    axis label. (ii) the tier values render as friendly labels **"User" /
    "Project (shared)" / "Project (local)"** (KO "사용자" / "프로젝트(공유)" /
    "프로젝트(로컬)"), each with a defining tooltip — a **narrow supersession
    of ADR-0016 §7 for Web display copy only**, recorded in the §7
    supersession note in ADR-0016.
  - **Scope of the supersession:** Web UI *display copy* only. CLI `--scope=`
    flags, `?target_scope=` query params, MCP, config files, runtime path
    segments, i18n KEY names, and the `{tier}` placeholder keep the literal
    tokens `user`/`project_shared`/`project_local` unchanged; the ADR-0016 §7
    inline "no runtime fan-out" annotation on `project_local` still stands.
  - **Constraint (unchanged):** this display-only decision must **not**
    pre-empt the #922 `target_scope`→`target_tier` *identifier* rename
    (TRACKER row "0016 §2", deferred to 2026-08-11).
  - **Original lean (not taken — superseded by what shipped):** keep "Tier"
    as the rendered axis term + the literal value tokens. Other kept axis
    candidates: "Storage location" / "Visibility".
- **D-B. P2 directional verbs.**
  - **Lean:** option (b) **soft** — keep the action names Sync/Import but
    add a secondary directional cue ("push to runtimes" ↑ / "pull into
    Store" ↓). Captures most of the comprehension gain without git-semantic
    over-promise or external-doc churn.
  - **Alternatives (kept):** (a) no verb change — direction carried only by
    the diagram + legend (P0/P1); (c) **full** rename Sync→Push↑ /
    Import→Pull↓ (highest comprehension, one-way, breaks external
    docs/screenshots) — still gated on the §Validation user test if chosen.
- **D-C. Status-merge — mixed multi-runtime states.**
  - **Lean:** defer any status collapse to **P2 only** (post-validation);
    when rendering a **mixed** item (in-sync for one runtime, out-of-sync
    for another — `context-gateway.js:1511`) use **worst-status-wins for
    the row badge + per-runtime chips** for detail, and keep the
    create-vs-overwrite cue on list/Sync-All rows *before* the confirm
    modal (do not hide it in the modal).
  - **Alternatives (kept):** collapse to a single ahead/behind/in-sync
    badge with no per-runtime chips (simpler, but loses the mixed-state and
    overwrite-risk signal at a glance); keep today's four-status model
    unchanged (no collapse at all).
- **D-D. Simple-mode empty-tier handling.**
  - **Lean:** option (iii) a **read-only empty-state summary** that names
    which other tier holds items ("3 items in your User tier — open
    Advanced to manage") *without* changing the active tier — preserves the
    stable `project_shared` default (ADR-0015/0016) while staying
    discoverable.
  - **Alternatives (kept):** (i) a plain "turn on Advanced" hint only;
    (ii) **auto-switch** the active tier to the populated one (rejected in
    the lean — conflicts with the stable default, but recorded for
    re-evaluation).
- **D-E. Sequencing + a single glossary owner.**
  - **Lean:** designate **this ADR's §"A single user-facing display
    glossary" as the source-of-truth**; land **P0 before** #1351's bulk
    ko.json pass so translation localizes against settled terms; coordinate
    P0-4's `en.json:415` rewrite with #1348 (same string) so they don't
    double-churn.
  - **Alternatives (kept):** let #1351 land first and have this ADR conform
    to whatever terms emerge; or run them fully in parallel with a
    post-hoc reconciliation pass (higher churn risk).
- **D-F. Default-flip blast radius.**
  - **Lean:** **staged opt-in first** — ship Simple mode with **Advanced as
    the default**, gather the §Validation user-test signal, then flip the
    default in a follow-up (with the onboarding-docs fan-out in the same
    change), per the repo's default-change discipline. Keep the toggle
    visible (not buried) as the rollback signal.
  - **Alternatives (kept):** flip Simple-as-default immediately (with
    same-change docs fan-out) — faster comprehension win, larger blast
    radius and weaker rollback signal.
- **D-G. Accessibility & localization of the new visual onboarding.**
  - **Lean:** make a11y a **P0 gate** (not deferred): the Store→Runtimes
    diagram must carry an equivalent text alternative (it is never the only
    carrier of the model — the primer prose is), the legend/tooltips must be
    keyboard-reachable and focus-visible, status must not be color-only,
    and the layout must render in dark mode and survive RTL/localized
    widths. Add these as acceptance criteria to P0 item 6 (i18n/gate
    hygiene).
  - **Alternatives (kept):** treat a11y polish as a fast-follow after P0
    ships (rejected in the lean — the diagram/legend are comprehension-
    critical, so their a11y is load-bearing, not polish).

If this ADR is accepted with P2 left deferred, add a TRACKER.md row for
D-B/D-C (trigger: the §Validation first-run user test) pointing at #1353.

## References

**Issues**

- #1353 — tracking issue (first-time-user onboarding & IA); this ADR's home.
- #1348 / #1349 / #1350 / #1351 / #1352 — string-level companions (raw
  move/copy verbs; portal empty-state; `reason_code`→i18n leaks; ko.json
  gap + install-guide literals; wording polish).
- #922 — deferred `target_scope`→`target_tier` identifier rename
  (ADR-0016); D-A must not pre-empt it.

**ADRs**

- ADR-0009 — Context Gateway dashboard info surface (the surface this
  layer annotates).
- ADR-0011 §3 — `project_local` has no runtime fan-out (load-bearing for
  the diagram + the "Draft, never pushed" definition).
- ADR-0015 — request vocabulary `project_scope_id` / `target_scope` and
  the retirement of unqualified "scope" (load-bearing for §2 / D-A);
  this ADR is the display-layer counterpart and does not change it.
- ADR-0016 §7 ("CLI / Web UI user-facing names") — originally **pinned**
  the literal tier tokens for user-facing surfaces and rejected display
  aliases; **D-A (decided 2026-06-17) narrowly supersedes it for Context
  Gateway Web display copy only** (CLI / params / config / identifiers keep
  the literal tokens — see the §7 supersession note). §"Open questions"
  raises the
  deferred `target_scope`→`target_tier` *identifier* rename (bound to #922
  with a 2026-08-11 review window in TRACKER.md, row "0016 §2"); D-A must
  not pre-empt it.
- ADR-0021 — Context portal (the Projects portal whose dual project
  identity P0-5 fixes).
- ADR-0023 — cross-project artifact transfer (the move/copy flow whose
  confirm copy P0-4 rewrites).
