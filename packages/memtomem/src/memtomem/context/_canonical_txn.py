"""Canonical-mutation lock primitives (ADR-0030 §6, PR-B2a).

Every first-party write to a canonical context artifact — reverse import
(Pull), web CRUD, wiki install/update, cross-scope transfer, flat→dir migrate,
and the version/label operations — must serialize against every other such
write on the *same artifact* across processes. Before PR-B2a only the skills
reverse-import path held a destination sidecar lock; agents/commands reverse
imports, web canonical CRUD (the in-process ``_gateway_lock`` only), wiki
install/update, and the version-create snapshot read all wrote/read canonicals
unguarded, and ``migrate``/``transfer`` locked the *file path* (``.foo.md.lock``
for flat, ``<name>/.<file>.lock`` for dir) — which does not serialize against a
name-keyed lock on the same artifact.

This module is the one authority for the canonical lock. Its identity is
**name-keyed and layout-independent**: ``<canonical_root>/.{name}.lock`` guards
the flat file ``<root>/<name>.md`` and the dir working file
``<root>/<name>/<agent|command>.md`` (and the skills tree ``<root>/<name>/``)
alike, so the two layouts of one name — and a Pull racing a flat→dir migrate —
can never write concurrently. This is byte-identical to the lock the skills
importer already takes (``_lock_path_for(canonical_root / skill)``).

**Lock order (normative, ADR-0030 §6).** Within the context-artifact domain:

    1. the canonical name-keyed sidecar lock(s) — ``<root>/.{name}.lock``,
       sorted by ``str`` when more than one is taken at once, then
    2. the child sidecar the operation needs — ``versions.json`` (version /
       label ops, via :func:`create_version` etc.) or the wiki ``lock.json``
       (install/update). The two children are parallel, never nested with each
       other.

Never acquire a canonical sidecar while holding a child lock. This module
imports :mod:`memtomem.context.versioning`, never the reverse. This is a
different domain from the memory-file lock order in
:mod:`memtomem.context._atomic` (L0–L4) and never nests with it.

**Event-loop callers.** :func:`_file_lock` is a *blocking* ``LOCK_EX`` — calling
it synchronously on an event loop can deadlock (a suspended lock-holder task can
never release; see the L2 note in :mod:`memtomem.context._atomic`). Async web
handlers run these helpers in a worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) with the
in-process ``_gateway_lock`` held; ``_gateway_lock`` is what serializes
in-process callers so the worker-thread flock never self-contends.
