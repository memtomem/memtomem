# Set up memtomem

Derive the memory source path from the current user request.
If the request does not clearly specify the memory source path, ask before calling a tool — and
in a non-interactive context (a subagent or scripted run with nobody to ask), do not
stall and do not guess: stop and report `insufficient_input` naming the missing memory source path.
A request that does specify the memory source path proceeds normally in either context.
1. Call `mem_status` and treat the default `provider=none` BM25-only configuration as healthy.
2. A fresh machine needs no bootstrap: without a memtomem config the server uses its defaults (BM25, `~/.memtomem`). Do not suggest `mm init` or any other command that rewrites memtomem's configuration; an existing configuration may serve other agents. This server runs at user scope; do not suggest project-specific setup from this host.
3. Obtain an explicit notes or memory directory from the request; ask for one when absent. The path must be absolute (or start with `~`): this server's working directory is the plugin directory, so a relative path would point inside the plugin.
4. Call `mem_index` on that path with `force=false` and `auto_tag=false`. This is a one-shot index and must not silently register a watcher root.
5. Choose a representative phrase from the indexed material and call `mem_search` to verify retrieval.
6. Report the effective DB path, indexed path, and first-success result. Mention embeddings only as an optional relevance enhancement.

Do not install Ollama, enable automation hooks, or edit host instruction files unless the user separately requests those actions.
